Hello!

This is a collection of homework assignments for Coursera's "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python" (https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-2)

All of this snippets of code were made to run in CodeSkulptor (https://py2.codeskulptor.org/).

UPDATE 04/06/2021 - asteroids.py stopped working, will try to fix it eventually.
